# Ratiometric-GPCR-signaling-enables-directional-sensing-in-yeast
This repository is a summary of my mathematical derivations, simulations, and experiments for "Ratiometric GPCR signaling enables directional sensing in yeast" (https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.3000484)

## Fig 2G Inferring protein dynamics from fluorescent data

I show how visible triangle-wave-like oscillations in fluorescent intensity observed in a cell can arise from underlying square-wave oscillations of the actual protein concentration.

## Fig 4D and E FRAP to estimate diffusion constant of membrane proteins

I conducted fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to determine the diffusion constant of receptors in a yeast cellâ€™s plasma membrane.

## Fig 8B and C Rationmetric vs non-rationmetric sensing

Derived (see .mlx file for derivation) and plotted equation for the difference in active G-protein concentration between the two ends of the gradient predicted by the ratiometric model divided by that predicted by the nonratiometric model.
